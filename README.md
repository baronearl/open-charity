# open-charity
A sample project from Compucorp
I’ve successfully lauched the website and drupal 7 theme as well. I encountered some challenges while trying to use AWS.
My credit card was rejected by their system of which I know no reason about it. I then hosted the website on a shared hosting server.
I was able to use SCSS but it couldn’t compile on the shared hosting so I renamed it default.scss inside the CSS folder of the theme 
so it won’t conflict with the names of the stylesheets and make it not no render.
The logo was the only image provided for running the website so I had to crop some part of the images from the demo picture sent for 
the website design. Then the ones I couldn’t crop, I was able to source for a replacement picture.
I concentrated mainly on the Home page design since it was the major design I was shown.
The site has all the properties needed to make a good theme.
